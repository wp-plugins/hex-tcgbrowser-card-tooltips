represents a Hex TCG card name, and click the button. It will turn the text into a
link to the card's page on http://hex.tcgbrowser.com. Note that the tooltips will work only after
you publish or preview the post.

    to install the zip file.

== Changelog ==

= 1.5 =
Added support for different cards with the same name.

Usage:
To display the AA version of a card, add '-AA' at the end. For troop/champion/mercenary, add '-Troop', '-Champion' or '-Mercenary'.

The plugin will remove the suffix, but the correct card will still be linked.

E.g.
Burn-AA
Living Totem-AA
Zoltog-Mercenary
Zoltog-Champion
Zoltog-Troop

Note: If no suffix is added for a card that exists both as Troop and other type like Mercenary or Champion, the troop version will be selected.
